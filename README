Strawpoll Clone
=======
This is a polling application. 

It allows you to make a poll with as many options as you'd like,
and then have others cast votes for which option they like the best. There is a results page that you can view for each poll and it updates in realtime. You can view a demo [here](http://strawpoll.tbrown.im)

This project is a clone of [strawpoll.me](http://strawpoll.me).
